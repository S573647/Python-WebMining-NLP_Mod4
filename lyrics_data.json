{"lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Imagine par John Lennon\r\nImagine there's no heaven\nIt's easy if you try\nNo hell below us\nAbove us only sky\nImagine all the people\nLiving for today... \n\nImagine there's no countries\nIt isn't hard to do\nNothing to kill or die for\nAnd no religion too\nImagine all the people\nLiving life in peace... \n\nYou may say I'm a dreamer\nBut I'm not the only one\n\nI hope someday you'll join us\nAnd the world will be as one \n\nImagine no possessions\nI wonder if you can\nNo need for greed or hunger\nA brotherhood of man\nImagine all the people\nSharing all the world... \n\nYou may say I'm a dreamer\nBut I'm not the only one\nI hope someday you'll join us\nAnd the world will live as one"}
